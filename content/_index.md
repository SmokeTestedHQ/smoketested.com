Welcome to my digital lab â€” a place where I share my personal projects, experiments, and early prototypes. This site is a collection of ideas in progress, technical explorations, and creative sparks. Whether you're here for inspiration, collaboration, or curiosity, I hope you find something that sparks your interest.
